# Evoastra_Data_Science_Major_Project
This project involves analyzing loan data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify factors influencing loan default. The aim is to detect missing data, outliers, and data imbalance, and use univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover patterns. You'll identify key correlations in the data to differentiate between clients with payment difficulties and those without, presenting findings through visualizations and providing insights to guide better lending decisions.
